Accepted for publication to NAR (Dec 2012).\r\n\r\nThis program can be used to take a sparse contact dataset and interpolate it to a sampled matrix at an arbitrary resolution. On top of the resulting matrix, any set of annotation of loci is then inspected for co-localization both in 3d and 1d.\r\nThe result can then optionally be displayed in a figure similar to Figure 3 in the above paper.","name":"INSP3CT"}
